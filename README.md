# Semantic-scene-synthesis
Semantic scene synthesis from a single depth image. This is used in assistive aid systems for visually impaired and blind people. It allows them to understand their surroundings by the touch sense.

# Coming soon:
In addition to the described future works, we are willing to:
- Migrate the project to python 3.8+.  
- Add documentation.  
- Optimize the code.
